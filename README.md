# UsingHashTable
Get distinct error messages from a sql table. 
Iterate through each error message to find all the devices failing with that error message. 
Create a hash table for each error message and a key value. 
I want the key to be short and brief instead of full error message so that i can append it in Ticketing column.
We are using Alerting system API's to create incidents
